YouTube Video Question Answering Service
This MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack service utilizes generative AI from OpenAI to extract answers from YouTube videos based on user-provided questions.


Features

Question Answering: The service accepts a YouTube video URL and a question through its API. It then analyzes the video content using OpenAI's generative AI to find the answer to the question.

Scalability: Currently, the service can handle videos of up to 6 to 7 minutes in length. Future upgrades are planned to support longer videos.

Video Simplification: Users can simplify YouTube videos, take notes, ask doubts, and pose questions through the API.

Explanatory Answers: The AI provides answers with explanations, allowing users to better understand the content of the videos.


Usage

Input: Provide a YouTube video URL and a question to the service through its API.

Processing: The service uses OpenAI's generative AI to analyze the video content and find the answer to the question.

Output: Receive the answer as a response from the service, along with any additional explanations provided by the AI.


Future Upgrades

Support for Longer Videos: Enhancements are planned to allow the service to handle videos of longer durations efficiently.

Improved Performance: Continuous improvements will be made to enhance the performance and accuracy of the question-answering functionality.

User Interface: A user-friendly interface may be developed in the future to facilitate easier interaction with the service.
